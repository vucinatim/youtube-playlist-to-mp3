# Desktop Dev (Electron)

Quick-start dev for the desktop app (runs Next + Flask + Electron together):

1. Install dependencies
   - Node: pnpm i
   - Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - ffmpeg: ensure ffmpeg is installed on PATH (brew install ffmpeg on macOS)
2. Run all processes together

```
pnpm dev:desktop
```

This will start:
- Next on http://localhost:3000
- Flask on http://127.0.0.1:5328
- Electron pointing to http://localhost:3000

Production bundling (WIP):
- Package Flask with PyInstaller per OS and bundle ffmpeg binaries.
- Use electron-builder to create installers and include sidecars in extraResources.
- Configure app data path for SQLite under the per-user directory.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- 🖥️ Node.js and pnpm (or npm/yarn) installed.
- 🐍 Python 3 installed (for the backend download server).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vucinatim/youtube-playlist-to-mp3.git
    cd youtube-playlist-mp3-downloader
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are using the correct Python environment if you use tools like venv or conda
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Variables

-   Configure a `.env.local` file in the project root.
-   Add your YouTube Data API v3 key:
    ```
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    You can get an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) by enabling the "YouTube Data API v3".

### Running Locally

This project uses a Next.js frontend and a separate Flask backend for handling downloads. You need to run **both** servers concurrently for local development.

**Using the integrated script (Recommended):**

Run the following command in your terminal. It uses `concurrently` (installed as a dev dependency) to start both servers:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will:

-   Start the Next.js development server (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).
-   Start the Flask backend server (usually on `http://localhost:5328`).

Logs from both servers will be shown in the same terminal.

**Running servers separately (Alternative):**

If you prefer, you can run them in separate terminals:

1.  **Terminal 1 (Flask Backend):**
    ```bash
    # Make sure your Python environment is active if needed (e.g., source .venv/bin/activate)
    python backend/app.py
    ```
2.  **Terminal 2 (Next.js Frontend):**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev:next
    ```

Your application should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
